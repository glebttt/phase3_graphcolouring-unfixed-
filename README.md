### Notes:

1. Classes should always be in their own file (import issues!)
2. Classes should always have CapitalCamelCase names
3. Avoid println debugging ... it is the devil!
4. If code is useful, it should be in the file. If it isn't useful, it should be removed.  Avoid the purgatory of the "commented out code"
5. Classes should do one job.  A class that does two things might need to be two classes.
6. You do not always need to make an object - consider abstract classes!
7. Methods should do one task, and should avoid modifying state if possible
8. Add e.printStackTrace() when handling exceptions to allow for developer feedback
